# Power-Unit-Reliability-Performance-Dashboard-Python-Excel-Power-BI-
Developed an interactive dashboard integrating telemetry and reliability data of Formula 1 power units. Analyzed engine performance metrics (power, turbo speed, fuel use, temperature) against reliability indicators (failure risk, component life). Used Python for preprocessing/statistical modeling, Excel for validation, and Power BI for visualization. Delivered insights on performance trends, anomaly detection, and trade-offs between speed and reliability under varying race conditions.
